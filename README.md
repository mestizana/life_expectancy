# Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and understand the relationship between life expectancy and fertility rates across different countries worldwide. It explores the constant changes in these demographic indicators and examines the variations between developed and developing nations. By studying and visualizing these patterns, we can gain insights into the factors influencing population dynamics and make informed predictions for the future.

## Goals
- Analyze the trends and correlations between life expectancy and fertility rate over time.
- Investigate the impact of socio-economic factors on fertility rates in developed and developing countries.
- Compare and contrast fertility rates between regions and identify significant variations.
- Utilize data visualization techniques to present key findings intuitively and compellingly.
- Provide actionable insights to policymakers, researchers, and organizations working in population dynamics.

## Methodology
- Collect and preprocess publicly available datasets on life expectancy, fertility rate, and socio-economic indicators.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, outliers, and trends.
- Conduct statistical analysis to quantify the relationships between life expectancy, fertility rate, and socio-economic factors.
- Create informative visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express.
- Apply data storytelling techniques to communicate the findings and their implications effectively.
